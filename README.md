# Zero To Production in Rust

Goal: Build out a newsletter app.

Uses Actix-web. Consider a rewrite with others for exposure.

## User Stories

1. • As a blog visitor,
I want to subscribe to the newsletter,
So that I can receive email updates when new content is published on the blog;
2. As the blog author,
I want to send an email to all my subscribers,
So that I can notify them when new content is published;
3. As a subscriber,
I want to be able to unsubscribe from the newsletter,
So that I can stop receiving email updates from the blog.

We will not add features to
• manage multiple newsletters;
• segment subscribers in multiple audiences;
• track opening and click rates.
